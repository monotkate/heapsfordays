This is simple example code showing the basic functionality of a heap.  Goes with the following blog posts:

## Installation

This code is written in Python, so make sure you have python installed on your computer.

## Running

Navigate to where you put the code, and then inside `src`.  The command `python max-heap.py` should run the code for a max-heap.  It will print a series of tests for functionality and display the results in the console.  You can change these by editing the command in the main function.

## Note

* min-heap.py is currently empty.  I intend to fill this when I get the chance.
* I'm relatively new to Python, so excuse any faux pas in my code
